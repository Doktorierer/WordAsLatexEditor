# Word as native Latex editor

Use MS Word as a LaTeX editor with a preview of LaTeX environments. Let the .doc with the generated previews be revised by co-authors and supervisors, who have no time to learn LaTeX. The revised .doc can edited further in MS Word, or copied back to your favourite LaTeX editor (just Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C).


## Files

* `LatexEditor.doc`: Example LaTeX document in Word with VBA-Macros (the pdf-version is `LatexEditor.pdf` (generated by clicking `Run LaTeX` on the new `LaTeX` Ribbon-Tab))
* `template.tex`: The premable for the preview of LaTeX environments
* `Word Customizations.exportedUI`: Import this file in Word in Ribbon->Customize to install the `LaTeX`-ribbon-tab (unfortunately, other custom ribbons get lost, but most users have not such addtional ribbons; ACROBAT special ribbons etc. get preserved anyway)
* `VBACode.text`: Again the VBA-Macro code of `LatexEditor.doc`, but just copied to an external text-file. This allows to circumvent certain anti-virus software problems when you try to store the VBA-Macros inside of Word.

## Problem addressed

* Some people want to write papers with Latex, but supervisors and co-authors may better revise in Word for various reasons. For example, some features of Word are good: Track change, commenting (better than `Overleaf` we have to admit), concurrent editing, comparing and merging files, spell/grammar/style check, section folding, etc.
* Converting a latex-generated .pdf to .doc is simple with good results: Open the .pdf in Word. The problem is the back-conversion of .doc to .tex. Though `pandoc` can handle conversion partially, you may still have to manually insert changes from the revised .doc back to your .tex file. Hence, we stay totally in Latex, without any conversion.


## Features

The VBA-code let you:

* Access all functionality through buttons on a new `LaTeX` tab in the Word ribbon
* Preview LaTeX environments: `equation`, `align`, `table`, `figure`, etc.
* Format some common Latex-markup to gray or white, labels etc. to blue
* Format Latex-section-markup into Word headings. Then you can e.g. fold them in Word.
* Hide Latex-markup (using the hidden text feature of Word)
* Run pdfLaTeX from Word and display the resulting .pdf

## Installation

* No specific installation required: The VBA-Code is inside `LatexEditor.doc`
* **Uncomment some lines of VBA-Code**: If in the VBA-editor (ALT-F11)  the lines directly under the text `COMMENT FOLLOWING LINE` are commented, uncomment them; they call shells. Such code may be flagged by anti-virus software as suspicious, especially during saving. So, if you save the .doc, and the anti-virus goes havoc, comment the code.


### Prerequisites

* LaTeX (with the usual `latemk` command)
* LaTeX packages: `standalone`, `preview`, `amsmath`, `amssymb`
* A standard installation of `gswin32c.exe` or `gswin64c.exe`, that is, `ghostcript`, must be installed in the usual progam folder on the c-drive. Info: Ghostcript is  used as the .pdf -> .png converter: gswin32 is the older 32-bit version.
* Required References in the VBA-editor are ticked (ALT-F11 -> References):
  * VBA Scripting Runtime (or similar named)
  * VBA Regex (or similar named)
  
  Else the code gives errors: Object not found, etc.
* Trust Center of Word: Add location of file to the Trusted Location. Best is also to allow all macros in all variations.

## How to use

* After you drafted your .tex in your preferred Latex-editor, open it by `LatexEditor.doc` (MS-DOS import works well; you can change teh filename), or you draft your Latex directly in Word
* For a nice viewing, set paragraph spacing to zero, and block align. LateX-comments should be written with two %% to be seen to be formatted
* Run the VBA-macro (accessible through the new Latex-Ribbon) to preview: tables, equation, figure, align etc.
* Prepare the file to your MS Word affine co-authors:  Convert the previews into inline pictures, and hide the markup completely


### Bibliography
There is no preview of bibliography. This can be done in 20 seconds manually. Run the runLaTeX-macro, or use your preferred Latex-editor to produce a .pdf of your work (which has the reference section), then view the .pdf with word, and paste the reference section at the end.


## Limitations/Bugs

* Tested on MS Windows 10 and Word 2016.
* Currently, you can preview and delete all generated pictures at once only
* Not all markup gets recognized, and labels, refs, and cites get not deleted
* The snippets when converted to inline-shapes do not wrap properly on a line on their own 
* Only ASCII character files work surely. The conversion is not fully UTF compatible.
