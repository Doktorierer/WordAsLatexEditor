# Word as native Latex editor

Use MS Word as a visual LaTeX editor, that is, you can preview LaTeX environments, and let the .doc be revised by co-authors and supervisors, who have no time to learn LaTeX. The revised .doc can edited further in MS Word, or copied to your favourite LaTeX editor (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C).


## Files

* `LatexEditor.doc`: Example LaTeX document in Word with VBA-Macros (the pdf-version is `LatexEditor.pdf` (generated by clicking `Run LaTeX` on the new `LaTeX` Ribbon-Tab, which just calls `latexmk`)
* `template.tex`: The premable for the preview of LaTeX environments (snippets)


## Problem addressed

* Some people want to write papers with Latex, but supervisors and co-authors may better revise in Word for various reasons- For example, the reason may to use features of Word that are good: Track change, commenting (better than `Overleaf` we have admit), concurrent editing, comparing and merging files, spell/grammar/style check, section folding, etc.
* Converting a latex-generated .pdf to .doc is simple with good results: Open the .pdf in Word. The problem is the back-conversion of .doc to .tex. Though `pandoc` can handle conversion partially, you may still have to manually insert changes from the revised .doc back to your .tex file.


## Features

The VBA-code let you:
* Access all functionality through buttons on a new `LaTeX` tab in the ribbon
* Preview LaTeX environments: `equation`, `align`, `table`, `figure`, etc.. Currently, you can preview and delete all generated pictures at once only.
* Format some common markup from Latex to gray or white, format section markup into Word headings, and hide Latex markup
* Run pdfLaTeX from Word and display the resulting .pdf

For more documentation see `LatexEditor.doc` (or the .pdf version: `LatexEditor.pdf`)

## Prerequisites

* LaTeX (with latemk command)
* LaTeX packages: standalone, preview, amsmath
* ghostcript, installed on default path on C-drive.
* Required References in the VBA code are ticked (ALT-F11):
  * VBA Scripting Runtime
  * VBA Regex
* Add location of file to Trusted Location in the Trust Center of Word.

## Troubeshooting

* If commented in the VBA-code, uncomment the lines with shell code. Such lines may be flagged by anti-virus software as suspicious code, especially during saving; see instruction in `LatexEditor.doc` for the lines
* If the code does not run and gives errors at creating objects, please ensure that the required references are ticked (see Prerequisites).

## Limitations

* Tested on MS Windows 10 and Word 2016.
* The current VBA-Macros are basic, and the code needs extensions
